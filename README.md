# SoundPad

SoundPad is a free custom recording application.
It is able to record up to 20 recordings. These recordings are saved and can be played at any time within the application only. 
These recordings are not distributed or saved off the users phone. 
The recordings can be deleted on the application. You can delete a recording and re-record. 

With user feedback and support there will be a feature to include importing custom sounds. 

Enjoy!
